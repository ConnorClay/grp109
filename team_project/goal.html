            <h2>Initial Project Details</h2>
            <p>This project aimed to create a website for a small cafe. The website was intended to have a professional and visually appealing design, showcasing the cafe's menu and potentially other information.</p>
            <h3>Key Features Planned:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>   <b>Visually Appealing Design:</b> The website would have a modern and professional design, including a background image and a fancy font for the title.</li>
                <li>   <b>Interactive Element (JavaScript):</b> A JavaScript-powered interactive element, such as a clickable tab in the corner, would reveal additional information about the cafe (e.g., backstory, values, beliefs). <i>Note: The specific functionality of this element was still under consideration and might be adjusted based on complexity.</i></li>
                <li>   <b>Nicely Arranged Menu:</b> The cafe's menu would be displayed in a well-organized manner, with each menu item including:
                    <ul>
                        <li>   A picture of the item</li>
                        <li>   A description of the item</li>
                        <li>   A link to a document (e.g., Word doc) listing the ingredients (if feasible)</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>   <b>Menu Layout:</b> Menu items would be arranged in rows of two for a balanced and aesthetically pleasing presentation. We anticipated around six menu items initially, but this number might be adjusted.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Technical Considerations:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>   HTML would be used for the website's structure.</li>
                <li>   CSS would be used for styling and layout.</li>
                <li>   JavaScript would be used for the interactive element.</li>
                <li>   We would explore the feasibility of linking to external ingredient documents (Word docs or similar).</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Project Goals and Outcomes</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Goal:</b> Create a visually appealing design, including a background image and fancy font.
                    <b>Outcome:</b> Achieved. The website features a professional design, including a background image on the homepage, and consistent styling across pages. The use of fonts enhances the visual appeal.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Goal:</b> Implement a JavaScript-powered interactive element (e.g., clickable tab).
                    <b>Outcome:</b> Partially Achieved. While a clickable tab wasn't implemented, JavaScript is used for interactive elements like the order calculator on the menu page and the image carousel. The interactive element goal was modified to fit the project's scope and complexity.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Goal:</b> Display the cafe's menu in a well-organized manner, with each item including a picture, description, and link to ingredients (if feasible).
                    <b>Outcome:</b> Partially Achieved. The menu is well-organized with pictures and descriptions. However, linking to external ingredient documents was not feasible within the project's constraints.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Goal:</b> Arrange menu items in rows of two.
                    <b>Outcome:</b> Achieved. The menu items are arranged in a balanced and aesthetically pleasing grid layout, fulfilling the intent of the original goal.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Goal:</b> Use HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity.
                    <b>Outcome:</b> Achieved. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript were used effectively to build the website's structure, styling, and interactive elements.

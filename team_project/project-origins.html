            <h1>Project Origins: Building Red Hills Cafe</h1>
            <p>The idea of this project came from the group trying to figure out a type of site that could show off our skills and would look like a real business and we settled on a cafe. We decided on a cafe since it would show off all the new techniques we learned throughout the course while still making sense for the theme.</p>

            <p>The project serves as a demonstration in our skills of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, showcasing the ability to build a multi-page website with interactive features. From responsive layouts to dynamic order calculators, this project aims to provide a comprehensive example of front-end development.</p>

            <p>This project is designed to be a learning tool, a portfolio piece, and a demonstration of practical web development skills. It's about taking theoretical knowledge and applying it to create something tangible and useful.</p>

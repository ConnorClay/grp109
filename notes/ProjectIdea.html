    <h1>Cafe Website Project Idea</h1>

    <h2>Project Description</h2>
    <p>This project will create a website for a small cafe. The website will have a professional and visually appealing design, showcasing the cafe's menu and potentially other information.</p>

    <h2>Key Features</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Visually Appealing Design:</b> The website will have a modern and professional design, including a background image and a fancy font for the title.</li>
        <li><b>Interactive Element (JavaScript):</b>  A JavaScript-powered interactive element, such as a clickable tab in the corner, will reveal additional information about the cafe (e.g., backstory, values, beliefs).  <em>Note: The specific functionality of this element is still under consideration and may be adjusted based on complexity.</em></li>
        <li><b>Nicely Arranged Menu:</b> The cafe's menu will be displayed in a well-organized manner, with each menu item including:
            <ul>
                <li>A picture of the item</li>
                <li>A description of the item</li>
                <li>A link to a document (e.g., Word doc) listing the ingredients (if feasible)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Menu Layout:</b> Menu items will be arranged in rows of two for a balanced and aesthetically pleasing presentation.  We anticipate around six menu items initially, but this number may be adjusted.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Technical Considerations</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>HTML will be used for the website's structure.</li>
        <li>CSS will be used for styling and layout.</li>
        <li>JavaScript will be used for the interactive element.</li>
        <li>We will explore the feasibility of linking to external ingredient documents (Word docs or similar).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Team Roles and Responsibilities</h2>
    <p>(To be determined)</p>

    <h2>Timeline</h2>
    <p>(To be determined - A detailed timeline will be created once the project scope is finalized.)</p>
